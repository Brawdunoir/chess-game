# chess-game
I worked in this project in class during my last year of highschool.
It's a chess game with graphic mode.

Because I hadn't background for object-oriented programming at the time, this project is without it.

## Functionalities
A beginner mode is implemented, to show where you can move etc...
No AI is implemented, it's a two player game.

## Software
It has been coded using [Processing](https://processing.org/).

## Authors
Yann LACROIX - front-end

Cassandra BATIN - designer
